# Logic Circuits

Using only transistors, we can already implement data processing using logic operations. Let's look at several examples of implementation of logic operations using transistors. 

Electronics uses mainly the charge storage for processing data. As you probably know, data is stored and processed in binary numbers in computers and electronic circuits. Then a given charge (for example, 5 volts) will indicate a high signal (corresponding to bit 1) and a zero charge will indicate a low-signal (bit 0). So, in logic electronic circuits we usually have a high-signal voltage source, often called Vdd (usually corresponding to 5V) and a low-signal voltage source, often called Vss (usually corresponding to 0V).

The logic circuits that are implemented using n-type and p-type MOS transistors are called Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor logic circuits (CMOS logic).
