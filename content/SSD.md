Solid State Drives (SSDs) are usually a packaged form of NAND flash memories with correct controllers and connectors to replace the standard magnetic hard drives (see <a href="Flash Drives.html">Flash Drives</a>) They are a more and more common replacement of magnetic drives in computers because of their fast read/write capabilities, even though they stay more expansive per gigabyte.
